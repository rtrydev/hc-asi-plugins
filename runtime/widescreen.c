/* HMC Widescreen — native widescreen + a working startup path for
 * Hitman: Contracts under Wine/CrossOver (32-bit ASI).
 *
 * The game is a Direct3D 8 title. Two things break it or spoil it on a
 * modern Mac:
 *
 *  1. Startup. In its default exclusive-fullscreen configuration the
 *     renderer asks D3D8 for a fullscreen device at the HitmanContracts.ini
 *     resolution and colour depth. Under the CrossOver D3DMetal/wined3d
 *     stack that CreateDevice frequently fails, and RenderD3D.dll then
 *     pops its own fatal error — "Unable to create device. Try changing
 *     resolution or color depth" / "This program requires that the
 *     display settings are set to high color or true color." This is the
 *     Direct3D 8 analogue of the DirectDraw exclusive-fullscreen problem
 *     the Codename 47 build worked around, and the fix is the same in
 *     spirit: don't use exclusive fullscreen. We force the presentation
 *     parameters to windowed, which uses the desktop format and always
 *     creates, and (by default under Wine) size the window to a borderless
 *     popup covering the desktop so it still looks fullscreen.
 *
 *  2. Aspect ratio. The projection is authored for 4:3; at a wider
 *     backbuffer the image is Vert- (zoomed, squashed). We intercept
 *     IDirect3DDevice8::SetTransform(D3DTS_PROJECTION) and apply the
 *     standard Hor+ correction — widen the horizontal field of view to the
 *     real aspect while keeping the vertical FOV — by scaling the matrix's
 *     x term. Orthographic (2D/HUD) projections are left untouched.
 *
 * All of this happens at the fixed Direct3D 8 COM ABI via the loader's
 * HMC_RegisterD3D8Hooks, so there are no game-build byte offsets to break.
 *
 * Exclusive fullscreen (Fullscreen=1) is REAL WINDOWS ONLY, and only at a
 * resolution the display actually enumerates. Under CrossOver on a Retina Mac
 * it is broken — winemac drives the captured display at a 2x backing scale so
 * the fullscreen surface renders larger than the panel and the picture spills
 * off-screen with the HUD clipped — so on Wine Fullscreen=1 is treated as
 * borderless-fullscreen, which fills the screen correctly. Borderless is the
 * right "fullscreen" on this stack; there is nothing to gain from the
 * exclusive path here (the present cost is the same under D3DMetal).
 *
 * Config: scripts/HMCWidescreen.ini
 *   [Widescreen]
 *   Enabled=1
 *   Fullscreen=0    ; 1 = exclusive fullscreen (real Windows only, at an
 *                   ; enumerated mode); on Wine/Mac -> borderless-fullscreen
 *   Borderless=-1   ; when not fullscreen: -1 auto (borderless, filling the
 *                   ; desktop, under Wine), 0 plain window, 1 always borderless
 *   FOVCorrect=1    ; Hor+ projection correction on/off
 *   FOVFactor=1.0   ; extra horizontal FOV multiplier (>1 = wider)
 *   PreserveAspect=1 ; borderless: keep the HitmanContracts.ini resolution's
 *                   ; aspect — the window becomes the largest centred rect of
 *                   ; that aspect and a black backdrop window fills the rest
 *                   ; of the screen (letterbox); 0 = stretch to fill
 *   CursorFix=0     ; hide the host (Mac) cursor over the game: 0 off
 *                   ; (default — see note), 1 on, -1 auto (on under Wine)
 *   FpsCap=60       ; frame-rate cap (the engine is frame-time bound and
 *                   ; misbehaves uncapped); 0 = uncapped
 *   VSync=-1        ; -1 auto: in exclusive fullscreen, let the display pace
 *                   ; the cap (present every Nth vblank when refresh = N*cap),
 *                   ; else vsync every frame; 0 off (software cap only, may
 *                   ; tear); 1 force vsync-every-frame
 *   MouseClipFix=-1 ; fix the mouse-look "edge wall" under winemac by insetting
 *                   ; the engine's full-window cursor clip so winemac switches to
 *                   ; relative mouse motion: -1 auto (Wine), 0 off, 1 on
 *   MouseMotionFix=-1 ; fix the slow-move camera stall by feeding camera motion
 *                   ; from the OS cursor instead of DirectInput's lossy relative
 *                   ; axis (buttons stay on DI): -1 auto (Wine), 0 off, 1 on

 * The H2SA build neutralises that with a 16-byte signature patch on the `je`

 *
 * Contracts uses the same RenderD3D lineage, but the renderer is statically

 * in this build's renderer we disable the ladder at the source; if not (the
 * expected case for Contracts), we log it and fall back to the runtime
 * D3D8-ABI clamps, which do not need any byte signature:
 *
 *   - fix_present() pins the backbuffer to the HitmanContracts.ini resolution;
 *   - the loader's SetViewport hook clamps any out-of-range (garbage) viewport
 *     back to that backbuffer;
 *   - fix_projection() rebuilds a collapsed vertical scale from the real
 *     aspect.
 *
 * Those clamps are inherently safe (they only ever *narrow* an out-of-bounds

/* Double-cursor fix. The game never sets an OS cursor of its own — its menu
 * pointer is a drawn sprite and gameplay uses DirectInput — so whatever
 * Windows cursor state the process ends up with is an accident, and under
 * CrossOver the macOS arrow shows through on top of the game.
 *
 * Two Wine facts drive the design (verified in wineserver/queue.c and
 * winemac.drv):
 *
 *  1. Cursor state is per thread queue. ShowCursor's count lives on the
 *     calling thread's queue; the effective count for a window is the sum
 *     over the queues attached to its thread input, and assign_thread_input
 *     subtracts a queue's contribution back out when it detaches. So hiding
 *     from a helper thread (AttachThreadInput -> ShowCursor(FALSE) ->
 *     detach) undoes itself; SetCursor/ShowCursor must run ON the threads
 *     that own the game's windows.
 *
 *  2. winemac only stays hidden for a NULL effective cursor (count < 0 or
 *     no cursor set). Any REAL cursor handle reaching the driver — even a
 *     fully transparent one — makes it unhide and clears its
 *     clientWantsCursorHidden flag, after which its "pointer not over a
 *     Wine window" fallback paints the macOS ARROW (seen when the pointer
 *     pins at the bottom of the screen, and during transient moments where
 *     the window drops off the screen list). An earlier version of this fix
 *     asserted a transparent cursor; that transparent-but-real cursor was
 *     itself what armed the arrow. So: never present ANY real cursor. Keep
 *     the current cursor NULL, the class cursor NULL (so DefWindowProc's
 *     WM_SETCURSOR can't set one), and the show count negative.
 *
 * The assertion runs from every game-owned thread we can reach:
 *   - the SetCursorPos IAT hook (mouse-look recentering);
 *   - fix_present (CreateDevice/Reset, covers mission loads);
 *   - WH_GETMESSAGE hooks on EVERY window-owning thread of the process
 *     (menus and DirectInput may pump input on other threads than the
 *     device window's). */

 * to the camera, and recentres with SetCursorPos. On Windows the warp is
 * instantaneous and raw motion is unbounded, so that just works.
 *
 * winemac only switches the Mac pointer to relative / associated-off mode — where
 * CGWarpMouseCursorPosition warps are honoured and motion arrives as unbounded
 * MOUSE_MOVED_RELATIVE deltas — when the requested clip rect is a STRICT SUBSET
 * of the display. A clip equal to the whole desktop is treated as "not clipping",
 * leaving the pointer in ABSOLUTE mode, where GetCursorPos is clamped to the
 * screen edges: push right or down and the reported position pins at the far
 * edge, the per-frame delta collapses to zero, and the recentre can't rescue it —
 * the camera stops dead against an invisible wall until you drag the pointer back
 * (and shoving harder past the edge is what eventually registers motion again).
 * Because the borderless window is sized EXACTLY to the desktop, the engine's
 * full-client clip == the whole display, so winemac never leaves absolute mode
 * and the wall is permanent. This is the same engine behaviour behind the
 * identical bug in Hitman 2.
 *
 * Fix: intercept ClipCursor and, whenever the game clips to (essentially) the
 * whole display, inset the rect a couple of pixels so it is a strict subset of
 * the screen. winemac then engages relative mode and warps/deltas behave — the
 * wall is gone, with the confined area shrunk by an imperceptible 2px. A NULL

 * DirectInput camera-motion fix.
 *
 * Contracts reads the mouse through DirectInput (UseDirectInputMouse; forced on
 * under Wine by ForceWinMouse) because that is the path whose BUTTONS work under
 * winemac — the win32 message path leaves clicks/firing dead. But DirectInput's
 * RELATIVE axis is lossy on this stack: winemac hands DI an integer per-event
 * delta taken from the accelerated CGEvent stream, and a SLOW mouse move rounds
 * to zero every event, so the camera stalls until you move fast enough to cross
 * a whole pixel in one event. The win32 GetCursorPos position does NOT lose this
 * — winemac accumulates the fractional motion into the absolute cursor, so the
 * cursor (and the win32-motion camera) creeps smoothly at any speed. That is why
 * with ForceWinMouse=0 the camera moved perfectly but the buttons died.
 *
 * This fix keeps the DirectInput device (so buttons keep working) but REPLACES
 * the device's X/Y axis data with motion derived from GetCursorPos — the same
 * smooth source the win32 path uses — while camera-look is active. Each read we
 * sample the cursor's delta from the window centre and recentre the cursor.
 * Contracts reads the mouse in IMMEDIATE mode (GetDeviceState into a DIMOUSESTATE):
 * we overwrite its lX/lY and leave the buttons/wheel untouched. The buffered
 * path (GetDeviceData) is also handled for robustness — there we drop the real
 * relative X/Y events and inject synthetic ones — but Contracts does not use it.
 * Menus (look inactive) are left entirely alone. Wine-only by default.
 *
 * It is installed by patching COM vtable slots (IDirectInput8::CreateDevice to
 * catch the SysMouse device, then that device's GetDeviceState + GetDeviceData),

 * window and painting its uncovered strips — keeps the game window exactly
 * the image: the Steam overlay (which anchors to the game window's drawable)
 * stays inside the picture instead of blinking in a fought-over bar region,
 * and nothing has to repaint per frame. Design constraints on this stack
 * (mirrors the H2SA build):
 *
 *  - It is created on the game's own thread (fix_present runs there on
 *    CreateDevice/Reset), and painted directly with GetDC+FillRect so the
 *    bars never depend on anyone dispatching WM_PAINT for it (macOS keeps
 *    the painted backing store).
 *  - Keeping a fullscreen-SIZED window in the app keeps winemac's fullscreen
 *    treatment engaged (hidden menu bar, raised window level, display
 *    capture) now that the game window itself no longer covers the screen;
 *    winemac's level adjustment keeps windows stacked above it at least as
 *    high, so the game window in front is not swallowed.
 *  - It is ALWAYS sized 1px past the screen's right/bottom edges (dw+1 x
 *    dh+1), as in H2SA. The backdrop is now the window at the screen edges,
 *    and winemac misbehaves exactly on a frame's bottom/right boundary: an
 *    exact-sized backdrop left the screen's bottom pixel row uncovered (a
 *    visible thin line under the bottom bar — the first HC port made the +1
 *    conditional on CursorFix and hit this), and a pointer pinned on the
 *    exact boundary counts as "outside" to NSMouseInRect, flashing the host
 *    arrow. The winemac fullscreen match is unaffected: a frame that COVERS
 *    the display still counts as fullscreen. */
